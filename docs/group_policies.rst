Group policies
==============

User accounts:
**************

Request for new user accounts on the group shared computing must be sent to group
leader (Galen McKinley) with CC to the server admin. Upon approval from group
leader, account will be created. Users authenticate through LDAP system and require
an active UNI to be granted access.

Data policy (contigency/disaster plan):
***************************************

Users are required to keep lightweighted files (codes, scripts,...) needed to
regenerate datasets (numerical simulations or other products) under version
control (git, svn,...) using a cloud service of their choice.

No confidential, sensitive or personal data can be stored on the group server.
All data stored on the group's server is considered public.

Users are required to keep their big files (>50 Mo) on the Google Drive
storage provided by Columbia.

All data stored on the group servers is considered as disposable and reproducible
in case of any event leading to the destruction of the present data.

Server maintenance:
*******************

Server maintenance is scheduled weekly (every Tuesday mornings) but can
happen more often if needed.

The system administrator is required to keep an inventory of all software
installed (as a batch install script) as well as any information useful
to reproduce the current state of the system.
